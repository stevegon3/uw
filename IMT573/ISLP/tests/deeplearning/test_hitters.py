    # ### Specifying a Network: Classes and Inheritance
    # To fit the neural network, we first set up a model structure
    # that describes the network.
    # Doing so requires us to define new classes specific to the model we wish to fit.
    # Typically this is done in  `pytorch` by sub-classing a generic
    # representation of a network, which is the approach we take here.
    # Although this example is simple, we will go through the steps in some detail, since it will serve us well
    # for the more complex examples to follow.

                nn.Linear(input_size, 50),
                nn.ReLU(),

    # The `class` statement identifies the code chunk as a
    # declaration for a class `HittersModel`
    # that inherits from the  base class `nn.Module`. This base
    # class is ubiquitous in `torch` and represents the
    # mappings in the neural networks.
    # 
    # Indented beneath the `class` statement are the methods of this class:
    # in this case `__init__` and `forward`.  The `__init__` method is
    # called when an instance of the class is created as in the cell
    # below. In the methods, `self` always refers to an instance of the
    # class. In the `__init__` method, we have attached two objects to
    # `self` as attributes: `flatten` and `sequential`. These are used in
    # the `forward` method to describe the map that this module implements.
    # 
    # There is one additional line in the `__init__` method, which
    # is a call to
    # `super()`. This function allows subclasses (i.e. `HittersModel`)
    # to access methods of the class they inherit from. For example,
    # the class `nn.Module` has its own `__init__` method, which is different from
    # the `HittersModel.__init__()` method weâ€™ve written above.
    # Using `super()` allows us to call the method of the base class. For
    # `torch` models, we will always be making this `super()` call as it is necessary
    # for the model to be properly interpreted by `torch`.
    # 
    # The object `nn.Module` has more methods than simply `__init__` and `forward`. These
    # methods are directly accessible to `HittersModel` instances because of this inheritance.
    # One such method we will see shortly is the `eval()` method, used
    # to disable dropout for when we want to evaluate the model on test data.

    # for the weights and *intercept*  of the map (often called the *bias*). This layer
    # is then mapped to a ReLU layer followed by a 40% dropout layer, and finally a
    # linear map down to 1 dimension, again with a bias. The total number of
    # trainable parameters is therefore $50\times 19+50+50+1=1051$.

    # rather than 64-bit (*double precision*) floating point numbers.

    # We provide a helper function `SimpleDataModule()` in `ISLP` to make this task easier for

    # it does provide an advantage for the `MNIST`  and `CIFAR100` examples below.
    # The `torch` package will inspect the process running and determine a
    # maximum number of workers. {This depends on the computing hardware and the number of cores available.} Weâ€™ve included a function
