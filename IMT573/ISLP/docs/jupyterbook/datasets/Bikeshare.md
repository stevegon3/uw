between years 2011 and 2012 in Capital bikeshare system, along
with weather and seasonal information.
     
- `season`: Season of the year, coded as Winter=1, Spring=2,
          Summer=3, Fall=4.

- `mnth`: Month of the year, coded as a factor.

- `day`: Day of the year, from 1 to 365

- `hr`: Hour of the day, coded as a factor from 0 to 23.

- `weathersit`: Weather, coded as a factor.

- `temp`: Normalized temperature in Celsius. The values are derived
          via `(t-t_min)/(t_max-t_min)`, `t_min`=-8, `t_max`=+39.

- `atemp`: Normalized feeling temperature in Celsius. The values are
          derived via `(t-t_min)/(t_max-t_min)`, `t_min`=-16, `t_max`=+50.

- `hum`: Normalized humidity. The values are divided to 100 (max).
