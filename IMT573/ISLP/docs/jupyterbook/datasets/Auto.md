## Notes

This dataset was taken from the StatLib library which is maintained at
Carnegie Mellon University. The dataset was used in the 1983
American Statistical Association Exposition. The original dataset
has 397 observations, of which 5 have missing values for the
variable `horsepower`. These rows are removed here. The original
dataset is available at [the book's website](https://www.statlearning.com).
