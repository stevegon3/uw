    "Before beginning this assignment, please ensure you have access to a working instance of Jupyter Notebooks with Python 3.\n",

    "1. First, replace the “YOUR NAME HERE” text in the next cell with your own full name. Any collaborators must also be listed in this cell.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Be sure to include well-documented (e.g. commented) code cells, figures, and clearly written text  explanations as necessary. Any figures should be clearly labeled and appropriately referenced within the text. Be sure that each visualization adds value to your written explanation; avoid redundancy – you do no need four different visualizations of the same pattern.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Collaboration on problem sets and labs is fun, useful, and encouraged. However, each student must turn in an individual write-up in their own words as well as code/work that is their own. Regardless of whether you work with others, what you turn in must be your own work; this includes code and interpretation of results. The names of all collaborators must be listed on each assignment. Do not copy-and-paste from other students’ responses or code - your code should never be on any other student's screen or machine.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. All materials and resources that you use (with the exception of lecture slides) must be appropriately referenced within your assignment."
